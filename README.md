A generative AI WebTV, powered by Zeroscope and Hugging Face.

This is just the frontend part, you will need the media-server (also open source) to make it work.

Warning: this is an experimental, proof-of-concept project made in a few days.

It is not ready for production use by other people! Also, this use models that should only be used for research purposes (no commercial usage).

Note: this won't work on iOS due to an apparent ban on Media Source Extensions (available on iPadOS).

It should be possible however to use some other protocol or library.
